       "*   **ESPN Fantasy**\n",
       "*   **Yahoo Fantasy Sports**\n",

       "### Common Types of Fantasy Football Leagues\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Based on Scoring Rules:**\n",
       "*   **Standard (or Non-PPR):** Players only get points for yards and touchdowns. Receptions are not awarded points.\n",
       "*   **PPR (Point Per Reception):** In addition to yards and touchdowns, players (usually WRs, RBs, and TEs) get a full point for every catch they make.\n",
       "*   **Half-PPR:** A popular middle ground where players receive half a point (0.5) for every reception.\n",
       "*   **Best Ball:** A draft-only format. You draft your team, and the platform automatically sets your optimal lineup each week based on who scored the most points. There are no in-season moves like trades or waiver claims.\n",
       "*   **IDP (Individual Defensive Player):** Instead of a team defense (D/ST), you draft individual defensive players (like linebackers, defensive ends, etc.) who score points for tackles, sacks, and interceptions.\n",
       "*   **Superflex/2QB:** These leagues have a \"flex\" position where you can start a quarterback, making QBs much more valuable and changing draft strategy significantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Based on Roster Management:**\n",
       "*   **Redraft:** This is the most common type. You draft a new team from scratch every single year.\n",
       "*   **Keeper:** At the end of the season, you can \"keep\" a certain number of players from your roster to be on your team the following year, usually at the cost of a draft pick.\n",
       "*   **Dynasty:** The most intensive format. You keep your entire roster from year to year, and the annual draft is only for incoming NFL rookies. It's like being a real NFL General Manager.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Based on How You Join:**\n",
       "*   **Public Leagues:** Open to anyone on the platform. The platform randomly places you in a league with other strangers.\n",
       "*   **Private Leagues:** The most popular option for playing with friends, family, or coworkers. A commissioner creates the league and sends out private invitations to join.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you can recall a different name for the platform, I'd be happy to give you more specific information"

       "Excellent question. Unlike platforms like ESPN or Yahoo, which offer standardized public leagues, **MyFantasyLeague (MFL) operates differently.**\n",
       "\n",
       "Instead of having its own named leagues (like \"The MFL Pro League\"), MFL is a highly customizable platform that serves as a \"sandbox\" for commissioners to create and run their own unique leagues. Think of it less as a restaurant with a set menu and more as a professional kitchen where you can cook whatever you want.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, the answer to \"What are the leagues in MyFantasyLeague?\" is: **Whatever leagues its users can imagine and create.**\n",
       "\n",
       "Here’s a breakdown of the types of leagues that MFL is famous for hosting, which is likely what you're looking for:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. The Core of MFL: Complex, Long-Term Leagues\n",
       "\n",
       "MFL is the go-to platform for serious fantasy players who want deep, complex formats that free sites can't support.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Dynasty Leagues:** This is MFL's bread and butter. In a dynasty league, you keep your entire roster from year to year. MFL excels here because it supports year-round access, multi-year draft pick trading, complex rookie drafts, and detailed historical tracking.\n",
       "*   **Keeper Leagues:** A less intense version of dynasty where you keep a set number of players each year. MFL's customization allows for complex keeper rules, like associating draft pick costs with players.\n",
       "*   **Salary Cap & Contract Leagues:** These are the most advanced formats. Commissioners can assign fictional salaries and contract lengths to players. Owners must manage a team budget, deal with expiring contracts, and handle things like franchise tags—mimicking a real NFL front office. MFL is one of the few platforms that can handle this level of detail.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. Advanced Scoring and Roster Formats\n",
       "\n",
       "MFL's customization allows for virtually any scoring or roster setup you can think of.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **IDP (Individual Defensive Player) Leagues:** While other sites have basic IDP, MFL allows for incredibly deep and nuanced scoring. You can have different scoring for a defensive tackle versus a cornerback and use a large number of defensive roster spots.\n",
       "*   **Superflex / 2QB Leagues:** Easily supports formats where starting a second quarterback is possible, dramatically changing player values.\n",
       "*   **Auction Leagues:** MFL has a robust and reliable auction draft module that is highly customizable.\n",
       "*   **Empire Leagues:** A type of dynasty league where the league ends and the prize pot is awarded only when one owner wins the championship two years in a row (or some other set condition).\n",

       "### 3. Finding a League on MFL\n",
       "\n",
       "Since MFL doesn't offer standard \"public leagues\" to join, you have to find one that is looking for new owners.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **League Openings Forum:** The MFL website has a dedicated message board called **\"League Openings\"** where commissioners post advertisements for their leagues. They will detail the scoring, rules, buy-in, and what kind of owner they are looking for. This is the primary way to find a team on the platform.\n",
       "*   **Orphan Teams:** Many of the openings are for \"orphan teams\"—teams in existing dynasty or keeper leagues that were abandoned by their previous owner. Taking over an orphan can be a fun challenge of rebuilding a roster.\n",
       "\n",
       "### A Note on MFL's Past Contests (MFL10s)\n",
       "\n",
       "For many years, MFL was famous for its own public contests called **MFL10s**. These were \"best ball\" leagues (draft-only, no in-season management) with a $10 entry fee. However, these contests were discontinued several years ago after MFL was acquired. The best ball format is now primarily found on other sites like **Underdog Fantasy** and **DraftKings**.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary: MyFantasyLeague doesn't have its own set leagues. It is a powerful, commissioner-centric platform used to build and host highly customized fantasy football leagues, especially Dynasty, Keeper, and Salary Cap formats.**"
